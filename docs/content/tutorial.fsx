# Introducing Pfarah

This document is a quick overview of the most important features of Pfarah.
You can also get this page as an [F# script file from GitHub][fscript] and run
the samples interactively.

There are two ways to parse data. The first way is to parse a specific file,
and the second is to parse a given string. The norm should be parsing a file,
but for the sake of the tutorial it is shown the second way.

If you're familiar with [FSharp.Data JSON][fdj] library, you'll be familiar with this.

## Quickstart

*)
#r "Pfarah.dll"
open Pfarah
open Pfarah.Operators

let obj = ParaValue.Parse "foo=bar"
(**

`obj` is a [discriminated union][du], and if you're not familiar with
discriminated unions, it may be best to read up on them because that is how
one interfaces with the data

[du]: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233226.aspx

## Working with the Data

*)

// Print the property's keys, so this will print "foo"
match obj with
| ParaValue.Record properties ->
  printfn "%A" (properties |> Seq.map fst)
| _ ->
  failwith "Expected `obj` to be a `Record` type"

// Print the property's value of "foo"
match obj with
| ParaValue.Record properties ->
  match (Array.tryFind (fst >> (=) "foo") properties) with
  | Some(key, value) ->
    match value with
    | ParaValue.String str -> printfn "%s" str
    | _ -> failwith "Expected foo to be a string"
  | None -> failwith "Expected foo to exist"
| _ -> failwith "Expected `obj` to be a `Record` type"

(**

## Convenience Methods

The methods shown are very boilerplate heavy and writing this kind of code can
make a project become bloated very quickly. Hence why Pfarah provides a bit of
syntactic sugar and helper methods to make dealing with the data easier.

*)

// The previous example of printing foo's value can be shortened to
let obj2 = ParaValue.Parse "foo=bar"
printfn "%s" (obj2?foo |> asString)

let data = ParaValue.Parse "y={1 2 4 8 16 32}"
printfn "%A" (data?y |> asArray |> Array.map asInteger)

(**

## Dealing with Multiple Keys

It is often common that the data format will have multiple keys of the same
name on the same level, but the number of occurrences of the key in an object is
subject to differ. In cases such as these it is best to use `collect`, which
will aggregate values in an object with that particular key.

*)

let army = """
army=
{
    name="1st army"
    unit={
        name="1st unit"
    }
}
army=
{
    name="2nd army"
    unit={
        name="1st unit"
    }
    unit={
        name="2nd unit"
    }
}"""

// Let's create a list of tuples such that the result is army name * list of
// unit names
let armyData =
  ParaValue.Parse army
  |> collect "army"
  |> Array.map (fun x ->
    let units = x |> collect "unit" |> Array.map (fun u -> u?name |> asString)
    x?name |> asString, units)
printfn "%A" armyData

(**

## Inconsistent Data

Not all objects of a given instance will have the exact same property keys.
Some may only have a limited subset of the properties wanted. The `tryFind`
function will return `Some ParaValue` if the property exists and `None` if it
doesn't.

*)

let ships = """
ship={
    name="1st ship"
    patrol=yes
}
ship={
  name="2nd ship"
}"""

// Let's print the name of ships on patrol
let shipData =
  ParaValue.Parse ships
  |> collect "ship"
  |> Array.filter (tryFind "patrol" >> Option.isSome)
  |> Array.map (fun x -> x?name |> asString)
printfn "%A" armyData

(**

`tryFind` is also useful when dealing with nested data. If you have `A.B.C` and
you aren't sure if `A`, `B`, or `C` exists, you can use `tryFind` in conjuntion
with `Option.bind` to select `C`'s value or `None`

*)

let nested = "A={B={C=1.000}}"
let cvalue =
  ParaValue.Parse nested
  |> tryFind "A"
  |> Option.bind (tryFind "B")
  |> Option.bind (tryFind "C")

match cvalue with
| Some(x) -> printfn "C's value: %f" (x |> asFloat)
| None -> printfn "C didn't exist!"

// Or a bit more concise if you're just dealing with values.
printfn "C's value: %f" (cvalue |> floatDefault)

// floatDefault will assume that if the value exists that it is
// a float. If the value doesn't exist then it will return 0.0

(**

## Exploring Data

Knowing the data is the first step to any type of analysis. This is made
difficult when there can be thousands of objects, each one having a subset of
the properties available. `findOptional` fixes this problem by dissecting a
list of supposedly similar objects and returning the properties that it knows
are always present and the ones that are optional.

*)

let nodes = """
node={
  definition=foo
  incoming={1 2 3}
}
node={
  definition=bar
}"""

// Print all the properties of the "node" objects in alphabetical order.
// Append a question mark after the property name to signify that the property
// is optional.
let required, optional =
  ParaValue.Parse nodes
  |> collect "node"
  |> findOptional

required |> Seq.iter (printfn "%s")
optional |> Seq.iter (printfn "%s?")

// Will print:
// definition
// incoming?

(**

If the data is in a difficult or hard to read format (eg. thousands of items
on a single line), call the ToString method, which will print a prettified
version of the data

*)

let mini = "names={Fred Jones Barb Barbara George Harry Hermoine Golem Sam}"
(ParaValue.Parse mini).ToString()

// {
//   names: [
//     Fred,
//     Jones,
//     Barb,
//     ...
//   ]
// }

(**

## Binary Data

The examples that we have been working with have been plain text, but
Clausewitz files can come compressed and in binary form. To parse these files,
we'll need a few things:

- The file path.
- The header if it is binary file. For instance, for EU4, the header is
  "EU4bin".
- The header if it is plain text file. For EU4, the header is "EU4txt".
- Since binary files use two byte tokens instead of strings for identifiers,
  we'll need   a dictionary of two byte tokens to strings so that the binary
  file can be queried exactly   like a plain text file. There are many types of
  tokens that can be encountered, so as not to   impose a memory tax
  unnecessarily if it is a plain text file, the dictionary is `lazy`

The following code sample will work for a file that is in any format
(plain text/binary and compressed/uncompressed)

*)

let path = "game.eu4"
let ``binary header`` = "EU4bin"
let ``text header`` = "EU4txt"

// Only if the file is detected to be binary will
// this dictionary be created
let tokens = lazy dict([(0x284ds, "date")])
let game = ParaValue.Load(path, ``binary header``, ``text header``, tokens)
game?date |> asDate
