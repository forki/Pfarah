/// A PeekingStream is a simpler wrapper around a Stream object that allows
/// for efficient peeking. The peeking mechanism is somewhat similar to a
/// StreamReader, except that a PeekingStream keeps the next byte cached so
/// that repeating calls to Peek only result in simple return instead of an
/// array lookup. This class was inspired by RapidJson's [FileReadStream]
/// (https://github.com/miloyip/rapidjson/blob/b39a8982699aed269a8db2c0d1319bd7ab04485a/include/rapidjson/filereadstream.h)
